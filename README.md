ðŸš€ **Excited to Share My Latest Project: Book Store** ðŸ“š

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project, Book Store, developed using .NET 8 MVC architecture. This project showcases a robust and modern approach to web development with the following technologies:

- **Entity Framework Core** for seamless data handling
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** for secure authentication and user management
- **JWT** for robust and scalable authorization
- **Select2** for enhanced UI/UX

The application features two main controllers:
- **BookController**: Manages all CRUD operations for books
- **AuthorController**: Handles CRUD operations for authors

This project was an exciting challenge, integrating various tools and patterns to deliver a comprehensive and functional book store management system.

Feel free to connect with me if you want to discuss the technical details or explore collaboration opportunities! ðŸš€
